#Self Service helpdesk using chatbot #

PROBLEM STATEMENT –
Minimizing costs, driving efficiencies & Increase productivity
In the enterprise, IT helpdesk has become an indispensable part of business operations. It is playing a critical role in supporting business users with uninterrupted technology services.
Without IT helpdesk, employees would keep running into level 1 general issues that could affect their productivity.
However, IT helpdesk efficiency is affected by a plethora of factors. These include:
Having to attend to low-value tickets.
Ongoing resolution of basic issues.
Employees approaching IT support team for trivial issues such as password reset and subsequently having to wait long hours till the issue gets resolved.


PROPOSED SOLUTION –
Many solutions have been proposed, like having IT helpdesk team to assist the end user.
What we are proposing :
CHATBOTS (as IT assist) :
Chatbots are simple AI programs that interact with users through the conversational interface.
Using AI in IT helpdesk will enhance human support in real-time to meet the demands of employees and increase productivity. Here are a few ways that chatbots can increase your IT helpdesk’s efficiency.
ASSISTING EMPLOYEES:
IT helpdesk support team helps in providing information regarding products and services of the organization, troubleshooting, answering FAQs and IT policies, whenever employee raises a request. Addressing these regular and repeated activities could affect their productivity and in turn affect the cost to the company.
24/7 AVAILABILITY:
Introducing chatbots in the IT helpdesk system helps in overcoming the issue of downtime problems and resolving issues effectively. They provide a unique range of options to solve the issues immediately
24/7 availability of a virtual IT helpdesk support staff brings in a superior value-add to the existing IT helpdesk.  
INTEGRATE WITH LEGACY IT SYSTEMS (ITSM PLATFORMS):
According to HDI: “As a rule of thumb, if an end user spends more than 10 minutes in a self-service portal, they cost the organization more money than calling the service desk.
With AI technology such as smart machines making their way into enterprise world, AI is, like it or not, going to be a dominant solution in any ITSM system.
There simply aren’t enough resources for analysts to get personally involved with so many requests and tickets.  For better or worse, human intervention for every request or one to one incident will not be sustainable. We will see numerous organizations use chatbots with AI abilities as a way to deal with.
Do employees need to call the IT helpdesk or fill the lengthy forms online to address their issues? Chatbots change these circumstances.
With the integration of chatbots, ITSM can be easier, faster, and convenient too.
MODERNIZING INCIDENT MANAGEMENT:
IT support staff find it difficult to categorize a wide range of incidents raised at a given point of time. Due to this, most of the repeated issues stand in the queue and wait for its turn to get resolved.
Chatbot in IT helpdesk provide employees with quick links about troubleshooting technique using the conversation UI. If the issue raised is among the repetitive tasks a chatbot is trained to solve, employees will be provided with the resolving techniques. If not, chatbot pops up an option of registering the ticket in their legacy incident management system.
chatbot also helps the support team by generating a brief report on the number of tickets raised on a particular day. It gives detailed insights about tickets which are opened/ in the queue/ assigned. It also provides an option to search all open/high priority tickets for specific support agent and set up an alert for the support team.
SELF SERVICE:
For most of the issues, time is the main issue, even if it is a simple task like password reset. Employees tend to raise a complaint in IT helpdesk and wait for their turn to get access to their logins.
These issues can be better addressed by integrating chatbots into IT helpdesk applications. Chatbots create a self-service interface where an employee can instantly get access to the credentials within no time. During this process, employee validates their identity using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and get the issue resolved without any helpdesk support staff interference. Thereby, the employee can work uninterruptedly by resolving his issues without any dependency on IT team and make room for support staff to work efficiently on other high priority issues.
LOW MTTR (MEAN TIME TO RESOLUTION):
Mean Time to resolution depicts the health of the IT helpdesk support in an organization.
By integrating AI-powered chatbots in IT helpdesk, most of the repetitive tasks or issues will be addressed by the chatbot using self-service options/ troubleshooting techniques. This reduces the number of tickets waiting in the queue influencing the overall MTTR. Lower MTTR is the key factor in showcasing the efficiency of the IT helpdesk service.
The more the tickets received and the lesser the time it takes to resolve, there is an upsurge in the business productivity and eventually its bottom-line.
REDUCED COST PER TICKET:
For every organization, cost, or precisely unit cost, is basically important. Cost per ticket is a measure of how effectively an IT helpdesk service conducts work and leads its business.
 TICKET ACTIVITY PERFORMANCE REPORTS:
Introducing chatbots in IT helpdesk helps in generating performance reports on the number of tickets raised, the number of tickets resolved, generate time-sheet and provide a report on frequent occurring issues.
IT helpdesk personnel or organization can invest in the resource to reduce frequently occurring issues and helps in increasing work efficiency of the staff and increase productivity to the company.
MONITOR YOUR AGENT’S PERFORMANCE:
Monitoring IT infrastructures often involves tedious tasks multiple interactions and gathering reports from different legacy systems. This allows managers to identify problems, maintain quality standards and improve the overall experience.
Introducing chatbot in such a scenario paves a way to get the reports by simply having a quick chat with the chatbot. Chatbot can be integrated with AD/user profile servers/performance review system to track the overall progress of the employees and scale the productivity.
It can generate reports of the individual performance on daily/weekly/monthly basis and keep updating the status to the management team.
HUMAN HAND-OFF:
An AI-powered chatbot operates turn-by-turn discussion with the employee. Chatbots recognize keywords provided by an employee in the chat conversation and respond by matching queries with pre-set messages in its knowledge base and assist employees quickly.
Chatbots, unlike humans, don’t always guess correctly, and invalid responses will frustrate the user. So, to avoid all these users are provided with clear and smooth transition to human agents.
